# Hireon

Hireon is a job search website prototype created as a concept project for a fictional startup company. The main idea behind the project is to demonstrate the structure and user flow of a modern job-finding platform.

## Project Overview

The platform is designed to help users explore job opportunities, view job listings, and navigate a multilingual interface. The website includes language translation features, allowing users to switch between different languages for better accessibility.

However, the project does not currently have a fully working API. Most of the data is static or partially implemented, and backend integration is incomplete.

## Current State

- Multilingual interface is implemented
- Job search and listing features are presented on the UI level
- Backend API is not fully functional
- Some features work only as mockups or placeholders
- The overall design requires improvement and refinement

## Purpose

Hireon was created as a learning and demonstration project to:
- Practice frontend development
- Experiment with multilingual support
- Explore the structure of a job search platform
- Simulate a startup-style product concept

## Notes

Hireon is not a production-ready application. The company, brand, and concept are fictional, and the project is intended solely for educational and portfolio purposes.
